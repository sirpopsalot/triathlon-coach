# Baseline Fitness Assessment

*February 4, 2026*

## Cycling ✅ Strongest Discipline

| Metric | Current | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Recent long ride | 36.7 mi, 1,138 ft | Jan 31 outdoor ride |
| Biggest ride ever | 110 mi (177 km) | You've done Century distance before |
| Indoor training | 2-3 Zwift sessions/week | Consistent through January |
| Endurance pace | ~12 mph on hilly terrain | HR avg 160 on long ride |
| All-time | 5,267 mi across 539 rides | Solid cycling history |

**Gap to Century (Apr 25):**
- Current: 36 mi, 1,200 ft
- Need: 80+ mi, 4,000+ ft comfortably
- Timeline: 11 weeks
- Assessment: Doable. You've done the distance before. Need to rebuild climbing endurance.

## Running ⚠️ Weakest Discipline

| Metric | Current | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Recent runs | None | No running in 2026 |
| Last run | Unknown — not in recent activity | |
| Run history | 650 activities, 1,200+ mi total | You CAN run, just not recently |
| Impact concerns | Knee pain history | Needs glute/hip work first |

**Gap to Alcatraz (Jun 7):**
- Current: Not running
- Need: 8 mi continuous (with sand ladder)
- Timeline: 18 weeks
- Assessment: Tight but doable. Start with aqua jog + run/walk progression after Century.

## Swimming ⚠️ Needs Attention

| Metric | Current | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Recent swims | 1 swim (Dec 9) | 685m |
| Frequency | Sporadic | Monday coached session available |
| Open water | Not recently | Alcatraz requires bay swimming |

**Gap to Alcatraz (Jun 7):**
- Current: ~1x/month
- Need: Comfortable 1.5 mi in cold, choppy water
- Timeline: 18 weeks
- Assessment: Biggest concern. Need to prioritize after Century.

## Strength ✅ Maintaining

| Metric | Current | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Frequency | 1-2x/week | Weight training logged |
| Focus | General | Need to emphasize glute/hip |
| Yoga/Mobility | 2-3x/month | Good habit |

**Status:** Supporting role. Keep consistent, emphasize glute med/min for run prep.

---

## Recovery Baseline

| Metric | Current | 7-Day Avg | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Resting HR | 74 bpm | 73 bpm | Stable |
| HRV | 22 ms | — | Low side |
| Sleep Duration | 7h 45m | — | Good |
| Sleep Score | 57-72 | — | Variable, often "Fair" |
| Body Battery | — | — | Need more data |

**Pattern:** You're getting enough sleep hours, but quality is inconsistent. HRV is on the lower end, suggesting recovery could be better.

## Overall Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Cycling base is solid — you've done the distance before
- Consistent indoor training habit
- Strength work is happening
- Schedule flexibility allows good training windows

**Gaps to Close:**
1. **Cycling endurance**: 36 → 80 mi (11 weeks) ✅ Achievable
2. **Swimming frequency**: Monthly → 2-3x/week 🟡 Needs focus post-Century
3. **Running from zero**: 0 → 8 mi continuous 🟡 Start with aqua jog, run/walk later
4. **Recovery quality**: Sleep quality and HRV could improve

**Readiness for Goals:**

| Goal | Readiness | Confidence |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Century (Apr 25) | Ready to build | High — if you stay consistent |
| Alcatraz (Jun 7) | Undertrained | Medium — swim/run need work after Century |

## Recommendations

1. **Now → Apr 25**: Prioritize bike volume and climbing. Maintain swim 1x/week. No running yet.
2. **Glute/hip work**: 3x/week minimum to prep for running later.
3. **Sleep quality**: Worth investigating — screen time, caffeine, stress?
4. **Apr 26 → Jun 7**: Flip focus to swim (3x/week) and run progression.
