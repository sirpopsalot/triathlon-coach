## Century Profile Training

The Ride for a Reason Century profile:
- Miles 0-15: Early climb out of Oakland
- Miles 15-40: Rolling terrain
- Miles 40-50: Moderate climbing
- Miles 50-70: Bulk of hard climbing (2,500+ ft)
- Miles 70-80: Final push to high point
- Miles 80-112: Mostly downhill finish

**Training implication**: Long rides should include significant climbing in the back half, not just early. Structure routes so the hardest climbing happens when already fatigued. Practice eating/drinking while climbing.
