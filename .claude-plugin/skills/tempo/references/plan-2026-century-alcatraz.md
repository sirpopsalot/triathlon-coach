## Maintenance During Century Build

### Swimming (B priority)
- 1x/week minimum (Monday coached)
- Goal: Don't lose what you have
- Optional: Add 1 solo midweek swim if energy allows

### Running Progression (Starting Early)

**Why start now:** 18 weeks to Alcatraz, starting from zero is risky. Build running fitness gradually while protecting joints.

**Phase 1: Aqua Jog (Weeks 2-4)**
- 1x/week, Thursday morning (pool open 7am-1pm)
- 20-30 minutes
- Focus: Running motion without impact
- Benefit: Builds cardio + running-specific muscles safely

**Running Readiness Gate (Before Ground Running):**
- [ ] Glute/hip routine completed 3 weeks in a row
- [ ] No knee/hip pain
- [ ] Aqua jogged at least 3x

**Phase 2: Run/Walk Introduction (Weeks 5-8)**
- 1x/week, replace one aqua jog
- Start: 15 min total (run 1 min / walk 2 min)
- Progress: Add 1 min running per week
- Surface: Flat, soft if possible (track, trail)
- Always do glute/hip work before running

**Phase 3: Run/Walk Build (Weeks 9-11)**
- Continue 1x/week
- Target by Century: 20-25 min run/walk
- Don't push — this is maintenance for Alcatraz prep

**Post-Century (Phase 2: Alcatraz Build):**
- Ramp to 2-3x/week
- Transition from run/walk to continuous
- Add brick workouts (bike → run)
- Target: 30+ min continuous by race week

### Strength
- 2x/week: 1 full session + 1 glute/hip focused
- Supports cycling and preps for running later

## Phase 2 Preview: Alcatraz Build

After Century recovery week, the focus flips:

| Discipline | Century Build | Alcatraz Build |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Bike | A (primary) | B (maintain 2x/week) |
| Swim | B (1x/week) | A (3x/week) |
| Run | Off | A (run/walk → continuous) |
| Strength | 2x/week | 2x/week |

**Alcatraz-specific additions:**
- Open water swims (if water temp allows)
- Brick workouts (bike → run)
- Run/walk progression (see workout library)
- Sand stair simulation (stadium stairs or steep trails)

---

## Key Principles

1. **Protect Saturday long ride** — This is the most important session each week
2. **Monday swim is sacred** — Best coaching available, don't skip
3. **Glute/hip every week** — Non-negotiable for injury prevention AND unlocks running
4. **Aqua jog before ground running** — Zero impact first, earn the pavement
5. **Don't add missed workouts** — Just continue the plan
6. **Recovery weeks are real** — Don't "make up" volume during rest weeks
7. **Sleep matters** — Check Garmin data; adjust intensity if recovery is poor
